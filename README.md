# Basic JavaScript Projects
This is a display of basic JavaScript Projects hat I have worked on in the past.

## Projects:
* [Slideshow](#slideshow)

### Slideshow
This project is just a simple slidehow that allows users to cycle through 4 photos. This can be doneby either pressing the arrows on the sides of the image or pressing the buttons on the bottom of the slideshow that correspond to each image.
